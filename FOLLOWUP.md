## How long did you spend on the coding test?

6 hours.

## Which parts were the most challenging?

Initially setting up WSL, Docker and Laravel.
Then figuring out how to use the files php artisan generates.
Dealing with routes and making sure they don't overlap.

I had some issues as I have not programmed in Laravel before.

## What would you add to your solution if you had time? What further improvements or features would you add?

If I had even more time, I'd either learn Vue js or set up Bootstrap after figuring out how javascript frameworks are usually imported, to make it look better.

## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

If there was a logging application such as DataDog, I would look there first to find out what kind of error it would be for php. Knowing the steps to cause the issue would also be useful here.

If it was a javascript issue, I would need to know what the steps are to reproduce the issue so that I can track down what components are responsible.
